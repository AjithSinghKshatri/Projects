"Absolutely love going here and would go again. I loved seeing the butterflies and birds. Such a good time"
"My favorite place in Key West. Surrounded by butterflies. I was a bit concerned about flamingoes, since they did not seem very happy. They were crying out and seemed to be seeking an escape? The usual tranquility was disrupted by their cries. Perhaps this environment is stressful for them? I have seen them in other places and they were not... More"
"The enclosed butterfly conservatory is well designed and accessible. A flamingo couple, Scarlett and Rhett, were free to walk among the visitors while we were there. Though they were not happy to see us (I tried to imagine my reaction if two flamingos strolled through my house unannounced and felt empathy with them) it was thrilling to be so close... More"
"The Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservency is a gem of a facility located almost at the very end of Duval Street just steps away from the Southernmost Point Buoy. We visited early one morning and stepped into a magical world of all things butterfly. The experience begins with an informative lecture about butterflies. There is also a film you... More"
"A bit pricey on the admission, but a visual delight none the less! A very well run and presented attraction."
"We had the best experience. I can not do justice with my description. This is a must see attraction. The wife and i had a wonderful time. I had a butterfly sit on me for just about the whole tour. were a bright colored shirt and you may have the same experience. We were so lucky to have the owner,... More"
"The Butterfly Center is about two blocks from the Southernmost Bouy. Basically it's a big indoor garden with butterflies, two noisy flamingos (Rhett and Scarlett), some turtles and a training center. Wow, sounds kind-of booring, huh? It isn't. The variety, colors and number of butterflies is amazing. The birds and butterflies are everywhere. Lots of exotic plants too. You won't... More"
"My favorite place in Key West!! The gift shop is truly amazing, then you walk into the glass house with the butterflies and the amazing sense of peace and beauty overtakes you. We went back just to do it again and felt the very same way. Do not miss!"
"The butterflies....we'll what can you say? It's an experience for everyone....the flamingos were spunky and very talkative. The people were very nice and gave us souvenir butterfly stickers to top it off."
"Totally cool place to visit. Magical butterflies, birds flying everywhere. Really enjoyable experience. This place is small but really laid out well. Even seeing the butterflies coming out of their cocoons. See why it's no 1 in the keys for places to visit"
"I went on my 52nd birthday and loved the huge area with many types of butterflies, quail, and couple other small birds. I just had to make sure there were no hitch hikers when I left the conservatory area. The place is warm and humid just like a hothouse, so, if you have allergies and/or asthma, this might trigger a... More"
"The first room you step into provides a nice overview of butterflies. Once you step into the conservatory, it is almost sensory overload. I've been to a butterfly conservatory before, but this one takes the cake. So many butterflies! They also have a pair of flamingos that were quite vocal and fun to watch. They stamp your hand so you... More"
"I love butterflies and birds. Even if you are not crazy about either of these animals this is a must see. The butterflies are beautiful, flamingos are funny and the entire experience is so worth it."
"Many varieties of tropical butterflies flitting about and landing on you. Alongside there are lots of cute birds, such as japanese quail."
"Wonderful time spent there with friends. The cutest thing is the little butterfly stickers they give out and kids wear them in their clothes or hair with pride. I'd definitely visit again."
"Good place to spend an hour, two at the most. Tons of butterflies; many more than I had thought their would be. Interesting wildlife running around, and a huge gift shop. Kids would probably love this place more than adults!"
"Skip the bars and spend some time here, so beautiful, nice and cool too. Beautiful tropical foliage, lots of birds too. Gift shop has lots of fun stuff at nice prices."
"The butterfly conservatory is filled with butterflies and you won't be disappointed! There is a pair of flamingos named Rhett and Scarlett that are gorgeous and several other species of smaller birds. The little quail that wander the sidewalk are darling so be careful where you step!"
"Wonderful surprise to Butterfly Conservatory. Definitely worth a visit. Three generations absolutely enjoyed."
"Heavenly! Loved if! The butterflies were so beautiful and landing on everyone. We also love the birds and flamingos and of course the gift shop!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"The Butterfly and Nature Conservatory has excellent information on the life cycle of butterfles and exhibits of pupae about to hatch. The butterflies appear ""free"" and the tropical birds add to the atmosphere of a tropical forest."
"Did not think I would like this as much as I did. Very interesting information and quite colorful sites. Lots of butterflies, plants and some birds."
"Very knowledgeable staff re: butterfly ? "" horticulture"" ( raising ) in the US & the world ! Who knew there were so many regulations !!! Lots of butterfly's too ( numbers ) compared to other sites we've been to."
"This is a must see for anyone with a remote interest in nature. It's a perfect little haven for butterflies and birds. The staff is fact filled and so knowledgeable on the different butterflies, their life cycle and origin. Coming into it with a biology background, it's nice to see the research and variety that exits. It's worth the admission!"
"Trip Advisor was correct again. This is one of the top destinations in Key West. This is good for children and adults of all ages. Wear a yellow shirt. Seems like the butterflies like people in yellow shirts. I had several hitchhikers though the exhibit."
"What an experience...so relaxing and peaceful....The butterflies are all over on your tour...they land on you at times...must ...we got some great pictures...the gift shop has some great stuff...A must see While in Key West"
"There are hundreds of beautiful butterflies and several species of birds in this magical place. We stayed for quite a while enjoying the lush vegetation and the butterflies fluttering around us. It was especially cool to see the kids reacting to the butterflies."
"You'll always have time for another drink while you're here. Take a break and come here. I was captivated by the serene spa sounds, lovely greenhouse, assortment of fluttering butterflies, tropical birds including two flamingos."
"There were so many butterflies, flamingos, amd little quail. I loved it. Price was 12 dollars per adult, it was a easy walk from the cruise terminal."
"A very small venue with lots of beautiful butterflies and birds!! The have a pretty gift shop too. Not far from the southern most point ."
"Absolutely overpriced from my opinion. The 'exhibit' is pretty small and I had the feeling being in a botanic garden. There are many butterflies but only a couple species. It took us 45min ..."
"We've been to several butterfly conservatories, but this one is by far the best. The preponderance of butterflies and gorgeous plant life is almost overwhelming. A nature photographer's dream. Perhaps the best place we visited in the keys during our 1 month stay. Don't miss it"
"They had a lot of really cool butterflies that fly freely in an enclosed space that you get to walk through. But, at over $25 per person, it's too much. I appreciate the fact that most of the $ goes to upkeep (hopefully), but that was too much for a 15 minute walk."
"We stopped here when we arrived in Key West. There were plenty of people but the lady on the counter was very knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. The display well well set out with some biology information to start, some caterpillars in displays feeding and then the most wonderful sight when you walk into the large conservatory. There were...

"Was a rainy day so wandered in. Very nicely surprised. Worth the few bucks to see. Butterfly sat on hubbys shoulder entire tour."
"The Butterfly Conservatory is a delightful place for a quick visit while in Key West. Bring your camera and your sense of wonder as you walk slowly through the small room jamb-packed with fluttering surprises. My friend and I brought our husbands with us; they enjoyed it as much as we did. Butterflies of amazing colors and designs will light... More"
"This little sanctuary is absolutely amazing! There were hundreds of butterflies every where! Many species of birds plus a new breeding pair. The gift shop has a variety of stuff to purchase as well"
"They have a lot of butterfies. Found this very interesting place to visit. It is worth a walk through."
"Wonderful, beautiful, relaxing place to visit. The butterflies were gorgeous and was neat seeing the different birds. Great place for adults and children alike..."
"A quick attraction to walk through but worth every minute there! The birds and gardens fantastic as well as the beautiful butterflies."
"We've been to many, many butterfly houses and while this one is small in size, it was filled with many different butterflies. They were everywhere and very active. The variety was better than most other places we had been. The cleanliness and garden feel of the venue was outstanding. And to top it off, the two flamingos were courting. I... More"
"Very pretty experience. A little pricey for what it is. Be prepared for your camera to fog up. It's warm inside. Great for kids and adults."
"Beautiful display of various butterflies and moths. Great way to take a break from the sun and go for a relaxing walk around the conservatory to view the gorgeous array of colors."
"Really enjoyed this! The admission fee was very reasonable. There were a lot of species of butterflies and some wonderful birds. The gift shop was nice as well. Recommend this activity"
"I generally don't like things like this but this place was pretty cool. Very calming, entertaining and informative. Highly recommended."
"Very interesting spot on Duval. Take a break from the bar scene and check out the birds and butterflies. Bring the camera and linger awhile. Def worth the trip and admission to see something so unusual."
"This is by far one of the best butterfly conservatories, and on the south end of the island, well within walking distance. The butterfly variety is amazing, and they might also land on you!!!"
"Lots of butterflys, helpful staff, very talkative. Flaminos on property were loose and in love. Staff explained ""talk"" between the birds, made experience much better."
"I love the Butterfly Conservatory. I always bring visitors here and it's always a hit. It is lovely and calming -- and amazing to see all the birds and butterflies set in a beautiful, lush conservatory. Don't miss it!"
"The minute I walked in the butterflies were flying everywhere - fascinating. They are absolutely beautiful and the flamingoes were a lot of fun to watch - they actually put on a performance for us."
"Great place to visit and see some nature. They also have a neat little shop. Well worth a stop in. Remember to bring your camera. Tons of butterflies to take pictures of."
"I'm not sure how we stumbled across this but am I glad I did only $12.00 to go in could have stayed there all day the butterflies were breathtaking and the flamingos Scarlett and Rhett are adorable, if you go to Key West this place is a must see!"
"A fun visit to a very colorful and amazing sanctuary for all kinds of butterflies. They actually will land on you while you study them .Very popular place to visit .I enjoyed my visit very much."
"They have lots of butterflies flying around in there. It's educational for kids to see. Very warm and humid inside. You can get really close to them and get pictures."
"This is a small place but I thought it was well worth the money spent. The first room has a few educational exhibits and an interesting film on the life cycle of a butterfly. The butterfly room is full of butterflies darting around, occasionally landing on you. I counted 12 species of butterflies. There were also two unusual moths I... More"
"There is a lot packed into the small observatory. We couldn't believe the number of butterflies as well as the colorful birds and the pair of flamingos. We were surprised to even see turtles. Don't be shocked if butterflies land on you too if you wear something colorful."
"Really enjoyed our visit to Butterfly Conservatory. Beautifully relaxing, also flamingos and turtles."
"The Flamingos Rhett and Scarlett were awesome. The staff was friendly. And yes there are butterfly's."
"Lots of butterflies to see. The flamingoes were the most entertaining. This is a great place for kids."
"It was fun and interesting to see the butterflies and watch them flit around. Also learned lots of interesting facts."
"We came here on the City View Trolley - it stops right in front. The young girl at the desk was very friendly. She answered a few questions we had and sent us inside. (Look for coupons online before you go. I found a Buy One Get One Free that I printed out). It was so green and beautiful inside,... More"
"Very beautiful place. Please find some coupon though which is easily eveywhere. It's very small though. You can easily see eveything in 10-15 mins"
"This place has a couple thousand butterflies of several different species free flying. Sometimes they will land on you. There also happens to be 2 Flamingos inside and its nice to see one so close in person. A nice calming trip."
"We went to Key West with our 2 yr old daughter. Reality is, Key West isn't very kid friendly so we were limited on things to do that would keep her attention. Normally, I would have never been up to going to the Conservatory, but I'm so glad we did. It was not what I was expecting. We walked into... More"
"Well worth a visit! We visited one afternoon not really knowing what to expect. The Staff were friendly and informative. After an initial display room we went into the large conservatory at the rear of the building. As soon as you enter its a real surprise as there are hundreds of butterflies fluttering about in just about every concievable colour... More"
"super fun place to see butterflies and the gift shop is amazing. I could have sent hours there watching the butterflies and trying to take photos of them. It was super hot and humid in there so be prepared to sweat."
"Honeymooning in Key West and we wanted to do something with our daughter before she left. We decided to go to the butterfly conservatory and couldn't be happier with our decision. To see the look on her face was priceless, and the staff was super helpful and knowledgeable. Highly recommend for families and couples alike."
"We were just looking for a quick activity on our final day, but this far surpassed our expectations. We had to drag ourselves away. What a peaceful contrast to the craziness of Duval. We're not really butterfly or garden people, but a walk through the conservancy captivated us. Would definitely recommend."
"It was a nice distraction for the kids. The quality of the exhibit was very good. It just seemed a bit pricey for what it is. The"
"This is beautifully done, well curated and simply a lovely experience. No one should miss it, that is , unless you are expecting monarchs. Monarchs don't thrive in any sort of captivity."
"This was a great place for my daughter after the long road trip and walk down Duval Street, which is not super exciting for young children. Definitely worth a visit if you are travelling with children and they are getting bored. The flamingos were pretty nice too"
"Love this place & visit every time I am in Key West. It is interesting, lovely & calming, definitely worth a visit."
"Visiting the butterfly exhibit was an amazing experience. I Was not expecting so many beautiful butterfly's and birds."
"Love, love, love this place! The butterflies were amazing. I got some great pics of the plants and flowers with the butterflies and birds. Very surprising visit for $12.00."

"so many wonderful butterflies and birds in this oasis of beauty that is not to be missed! So nice to have a little relaxation from the Key West heat"
"I have visited Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory a bunch of times and it is always just as beautiful as our first visit."
"This was by far the best butterfly conservatory we have visited. there are hundreds if not a thousand different butterflies lose in the habitat. Along with the butterflies are birds, flamingos, turtles and fish. This is well worth the price of admission. Please understand this is not an attraction for everyone. No bar, loud music, and such. But for families,... More"
"Small but excellent butterfly conservatory. Definitely worth a visit. Two flamingos in the center of everything made the visit even better. Closest I've ever been able to get to a flamingo. Fun for all ages."
"Butterflies, birds, turtles and pink flamingoes put an immediate smile on your face as time slows down and you slow your pace to rake in the beauty of it all. I'll stroll through here on every visit to Key West."
"Very interesting to learn about butterflies and their environment. Great place to visit. You can take pictures and video of the butterflies in action. Great gift shop. Highly recommend."
"I've been to many butterfly gardens over the years and this one by far ranks up there with one of the best!! Not only do they have butterfly's but also tropical birds, a creek that runs through with a turtle in it, some fish and the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen! It is really a place of peace and... More"
"My husband and I decided to do this. We both wanted to do something different and I don't think either of us were excited to go. We don't really care about things like this but it really was a unique, interesting, and surprisingly relaxing experience. Once was enough for us but highly recommend going."
"Very unimpressed...not as many butterflies as advertised. Might have been the wrong time of year. Facilities were very clean...even the bathroom. One sales staff was crotchety, the other very pleasant & helpful. My 3yo grandson loved it even if I was not impressed"
"Great place to stop for adults and kids alike. Different atmosphere than your nomal Duval stops. I love to visit every time i come to key west."
"Wonderful stop for us all! You can see the work and passion the employees have for what they do all over the building. There is a variety gorgeous butterflies and vegetation to lure you into thinking you're in your own private paradise. The kids loved it! Often counting the different kinds of butterflies they could see."
"I've found my new ""Happy Place"" being a huge fan of gardens & butterflies, I was still surprised, excited upon walking in. I happened to wear a colorful blouse, not realizing they would find a landing spot on me!! Yay! So, for my whole time there I had 2 on my head & 1 on my blouse. A definate stop... More"
"This was a busy place, interesting for a fairly quick visit. Rather minimalistic - first section after entering has some displays about the butterfly life-cycle, locations maps, types, etc, then the actual ""refuge"" where you walk a little path through a smallish garden-like area where some butterflies are flitting around - and a couple of flamingos are in the center... More"
"Tons of butterflies and some birds. Best part was the pink flamingos which were very active and fun to watch. I think it would be great for kids but it was a little boring. We got bogo admission on line."
"This was the best thing we did in Key West! There is nothing bad I can say about this! The butterflies fly all around you!!!!"
"A delightful experience....an absolute must do in Key West....interesting and uplifting in many ways. Good value too. Seeing all the stages of the butterflies life and then experiencing so many beautiful species up close was one of the best things I have experienced"
"This is a cool place. The butterfly solarium is not to be missed with hundreds of beautiful butterflies traveling through landing on everything including you."
"Not cheap, $26 before discount for a couple, but very interesting. You step into the conservatory through an ""air lock"", and from start to finish are bombarded by the most colourful butterflies of all colours and sizes. Plus there are more than a few varieties of birds, 2 flamingoes, 2 turtles and various fish. No time limit so can stay... More"
"It was a very delightful visit! Staff were knowledgeable and very friendly. Comfortable seating if needed. Price was good too!"
"The butterfly garden is nice and attractive with different butterfly species- they also have different types of birds. The staff was kind and informative. Overall small place and not much to do- you could be done in about half to one hour time. The souvenir shop is excellent with beautiful home decoration and jewelry pieces."
"I love nature and this was a perfect way to change scene from the Duval St. strip. It is so beautiful inside and the have flamingos! (:"
"The butterflies were amazing. They were very active and there were so many. The store is wonderful too. The entrance attendant was very rude and will not check you in if your whole party is not there."
"Couldn't believe how awesome this place was! Surprisingly one of the best parts of the trip.Once you go thru the doors it is simply mind blowing! Beautiful in every way and will go every rim I go to the keys."
"Amazing experience. Fairytale place. So many butterflies. Everyone who is visiting key west has to see!!!!!!"
"I went to the butterfly conservatory today and was shocked to see two large flamingos being enclosed in a very small (5x12) fenced-in area. They both went up to the people around the fence and were making a lot of loud honking noises. The conservatory has a sign up saying that it is mating season, which is why they are... More"
"Very beautiful place. The butterflies flying around made it seem magical. I was a little kid again at least for a few minutes. Found a coupon in one of the books in the stands on the street. That makes it a better price. Kind of small, but worth doing once."
"A tropical conservatory with rare butterflies and plants. The butterflies are everywhere. The gift shop has many reasonably priced choices."
"You will enjoy the gentle music, the rich butterfly and bird life, and lovely foliage out of the blazing sun!"
"This was a favorite for all of us! My husband, I and our two grown daughters. They also have a discounted price for seniors. It is an experience that will not be soon forgotten. Do yourself and favor and make the time to do this. We spent about an hour there, but I wished I would have stayed longer."
"We heard about the conservatory from a few traveler friends we met during our visit. Didn't expect much until we arrived - wow! This is an amazing experience. There are so many types of butterflies that flutter all around you with many colorful birds perching in the trees. Great education - kiddos with their families looked like they were having... More"
"Unlike many conservatories, this one was filled with butterflies, birds, and a lovely array of flowers and plants. It was crowded when we arrived as a bus tour had stopped, but the experience was wonderful The only issue here was the line for the restroom and the lack of hand towel paper in the restroom."
"I lived in Key West for 5 years and still go here every time I come back with friends. Lobby shop is loud and busy, but inside the conservatory, it's peaceful and mesmerizing, filled with colorful butterflies and adorable birds. More than just a tourist attraction, it's a break from the hustle and bustle if town."
"Small but beautiful little conservatory on Duval St. The walk through is short if you move fast but if you take time to enjoy the wonders inside, you'll be there a while. Many different types of butterflies surround you as you cruise through their habitat. Rhett and Scarlett are a must see. They are male and female pink flamingos nestled... More"
"An excellent experience of seeing and taking photos of butterflies in their natural environment. There are many different color butterflies to view."
"The butterflies are beautiful and plentiful, my favorite however was the male flamingo, Rhett. You can get very close and there is no fence so you can get some great photos. Rhett was so fun, he was more interested in the humans than Scarlett his mate."
"This was a fantastic place to get out of the heat and enjoy the butterflies fluttering by, listen to birds chirping and running water."
"Of all the things we did in Key West, this was our favorite. Been in several butterfly conservatories--this is the best. Good stop for the kids."
"It isn't a HUGE attraction but it was SO neat having so many butterflies flying around you and i loved the flamingos too!"
"I really nice place to go in Key West. There are exotic birds, as well as a variety of butterflies. Plan on a leisurely visit when you do go."
"We've been to Key West four times over 12 years. It never occurred to me this butterfly place was legit. I assumed it was just another tourist trap, a la Ripley's. No. It was totally cool. Lots of educational signage and HUNDREDS of butterflies. The staff was really terrific, friendly and informative. Be sure to look all around to see... More"
"Morning is best as it is cooler and butterflies are more active. Great gift shop for souvenirs and other items."
"Very well done. Video introduction is helpful and well worth watching to better understand what see among the butterflies. You will naturally move slowly thru the butterfly area as there is so much to see. A few birds and turtles to top it off. Be sure your phone/camera is charged as you will want pictures."
"Not really a butterfly person or care for them. This is an absolute MUST DO/SEE in Key West. The butterflies were absolutely stunning and it was a great experience!"
"Just amazing!!! You can go through as many times in a day as you want and the gift shop is really neat! Affordable and friendly staff."
"Put a smile on your face and have your camera ready ! If you do nothing else in Key West, spend an hour or so here and let the butterflies touch you !!"
"I was a little skeptical about enjoying a visit to a Butterfly and Nature Conservatory. There was something very charming about walking into a large indoor space with thousands of butterflies swirling through the air. It was also a cool reprieve from the Key West sun. The sign that says to watch out for hitch hikers was not a joke.... More"
"We always stop by for a quick visit every trip. It's relaxing and beautiful and just a nice way to spend an hour. The gift shop has lots of wonderful things to bring home."
"Went with a group of 8 from Big Pine Methodist Church. We had a wonderful guide (young man) who answered all of our questions plus all the questions we did not ask. Thank you so much for this visit. Nancy Holum"
"They had a problem with the card reader , long line in. Most people just went in but i thought educational video on the way in was good. lots and lots of Butterflies, some really big moth, and flamingos,, it was a nice visit"
"We loved all of the butterflies, flamingos and beautiful plants. It was worth the visit. The sounds of nature is very relaxing and a nice change from the rest of Key West."
"This is a simple but fun experience. There are plenty of butterflies as well as bird and diverse plants. Once inside you can stay as long as you like. Lots of opportunities to get close up and personal with the butterflies, especially if you want to photograph them, as they land on food trays strategically placed around the enclosure."
"It was a rare experience. I actually videotaped a butterfly on flower for over a minute. My son and husband also enjoyed this as well. I would recommend this to anyone. It was also very informative. If you love butterflies. You will be in heaven in the gift shop."
"Was worth the visit. Very many types of Beautiful Butterflys from around the world. Brillant colors and all sizes some as big as your fist. They also showed them in cacoons developing. We saw one stunning colored one be born. Get discount tickets all over town in flyers or attraction newspaper. Or take the trolly as we did and get... More"
"The butterflies are beautiful but the birds are stunning. A great rainy day activity for the whole family."
"Many beautiful butterflies and a few unique birds. It does not take that long to get through it but it is a lovely way to while away an hour. Such beautiful creatures. I am not a gift shop person. But. they have some unique beautiful stuff. I bought a wonderful plate with butterflies. Well worth a visit."
"I've been to a number of butterfly conservatories, and this one was small but rewarding. It didn't have as much variety as some, but it's not too crowded. Bring your camera."
"This place is awesome but you should keep in mind that you should go there starting at 9 am and the return later in the afternoon because in the morning they have a particular butterflies that roam the venue while at night when they feed them others are around. You can do this for the same price. In the morning,... More"
"The Butterfly and Nature Conservatory was lovely and very interesting. It was very clean and well taken care of with a major dose of magic- butterflies flying all around are pretty magical. It was a great break from beaches and biking. Beautiful birds as well."
"Amazing selection of colourful Butterflies and birds to admire and watch. We easily spent a few hours there in the morning and went back again in the afternoon. Would recommend an afternoon visit as it is very humid in the morning and makes taking photographs more difficult as the camera lens constantly steams up. It was a much drier atmosphere... More"
"If you are looking for a peaceful place to spend 30-45 mins, this is great for that. I don't know anywhere else that you can learn about butterflies, then walk through a beautiful arboretum where they are flying all around you. There were also two flamingos who were extremely friendly and curious. I got so many amazing photos of butterflies.... More"
"Butterflies, flamingos, turtles and birds, all in an enclosed climate controlled atrium that makes for great experience."
"We took the adult kids and grandkids here. The butterflies are just amazing and so many of them. But the birds are also quite interesting and the pink flamingos were in mating season so we heard the calls and watched Rhett show off his feathers to Scarlett. At first, I thought it a bit expensive but once you go, it... More"
"This was such a fun experience, the employee were very knowledgeable. We had so much fun and they have a lot of different kind of butterfly's and nature animals. Birds, flamingos, turtles."
"I really enjoyed this adventure. You walk in and there are thousands of butterflies. Soft music is playing, as you wander through the path. Butterflies are all around and even land on you. It is a wonderful, peaceful, and calming attraction that you will never forget! A must see in Key West!!"
"A must-do. This attraction is definitely worth the admission cost. The Conservatory isn't that large, but the minute you open the door and walk in there are hundreds of butterflies in view. It's the prettiest sight! The gift shop is also very nice."
"Great pictures and a fun experience for everyone in the family. I recommend the Butterfly conservatory to every couple or family visiting Key West"
"If you haven't ever been to butterfly house this is a beautiful example. A little on the small side compared to others I've been to but this one has flamingos and little flightless birds roaming around which are adorable."
"This was a very nice attraction and a lot of fun for a reasonable price. The souvenir shop is terrific as well. Very enjoyable."
"Very warm inside, but the butterflies and small birds were beautiful. A great place for everyone from kids to grand parents"
"We decided to go based because it was June (our flesh was melting from the heat) and they had AC. It was indeed cool inside the gift shop. As it turned out, we had a great time. There were gorgeous butterflies, funny little birds, flamingos, and amazing foliage. So we hadn't planned to visit, but really glad we did."
"What a lovely spot to view a variety of butterflies, flowers and fonta.And the flamingoes were showing off during our visit as well! Lots of butterfly information and a lovely gift shop to explore too!!"
"This is a very small attraction. I do not have small children anymore but the butterflies were so large and active at the beginning of the walk that the person I was with was frightened. I can't help but think that kids would be too. It is a beautiful exhibit, but very small for humans and butterflies alike!"
"If you get a chance while on your trip, definitely visit!! We walked in and all I could do was ""giggle"" at all the butterflies flying free!! It's just amazing, relaxing and fun all in one! If you're lucky enough, one may become your best friend (land on you)!! You can stay as long as you want (I think we... More"
"What a treat this place is very cool there is so much to see. There were tons of different types of butterflies several species of birds including two pink flamingos beautiful plants so be sure to take your time and really enjoy the view changes at every angle and take lots of pictures"
"It is OK. But it doesn't deserve to be first on the ratings. The beaches, dry tortugas, and Hemingway's House were better. It was too short, and you weren't allowed to try and get the butterflies on your finger. The people monitoring the butterflies kept on shoo-ing my youngest daughter's fingers away when she were pointing at the butterflies! Many... More"
"Key West is not just Duval Street for adults. The Butterfly and Nature Conservatory is well maintained and has a nice size area for viewing butterflies along with lots of educational materials. Both young and not so young will find this a relaxing, stimulating environment for learning."
"A must see if you are in the Keys. Very tranquil. We loved seeing all the different species of butterflies as well as the fish, turtles, & flamingos."
"We didn't actually pay the admission to go into the butterfly area but you can walk directly into their kind of gift shop area, it's beautiful and in one of the rooms they have all these preserved butterflies like artwork. it was beautiful and younique. I felt like I got the experience without paying anything. I'm sure the rest of... More"
"Saw many different species of butterflies and birds, flowers and trees. It was so nice strolling through looking in all directions at so many things! The flamingos were entertaining and beautiful and the butterflies are so plentiful they were just all around you. Very cool place!"
"more butterflies than you can imagine. was there for a wedding. Thought at first that it was a bit weird but realized after that it was amazing. Very fun."
"Quite a long way down Duval (if you're in the port area) the Butterfly House still makes for an enjoyable, if relatively brief, excursion. Well laid out in a pretty confined space there is a cornucopia of butterflies with many different species, some small birds and a few other creatures such as a couple of flamingoes. Explanations along the walkway... More"
"This butterfly conservatory has 100s of butterflys of all kinds. There are identification guides available to help you enjoy your visit. This is the 3rd time I was there and would definitely return"

"One of the main attractions on the South side, The Butterfly Conservatory is a beautiful indoor attraction. Butterfly's, tropical birds plants hummingbirds....what a wonderful place. It will only take about an hour to visit, although you can make it last much longer if you sit and enjoy your surroundings. NOTES: Go early to avoid the heat, and crowds!!!! A GREAT... More"

"Went there last week while in Key West. There were butterflies galore, as well as a pair of flamingoes, turtles and birds. If you are squeamish having loads of butterflies flying around you - don't go. If not - you will be amazed at the number they have here. It is very humid inside the butterfly house. Those with breathing... More"
"This is a great place to visit if you have young children. Please note however that no strollers are allowed into the Conservatory but they can store them for you if needed. You are also not allowed to bring in any food or drink. After purchasing your admission you proceed to a small room where you can read various displays... More"
"Wasn't going to go in but decided to and I'm glad I did! Butterfly's everywhere with a pair of flamingos too, go early you get your hand stamped and you can go back though later if you want !"
"The Conservatory is a great way to spend some time away from the busy, hot streets in Key West. Its not large, but very well laid out. If you take your time you will see much, much more than the gorgeous butterflies (turtles, quail, tropical birds). The gift shop is amazing as well."
"Really butterflies ?? Yes!! This was a pretty cool experience and one landed on me and hung out on my arm for 10 minutes as we walked around. They have a very unique green and purple bird that hangs out as well."
"Reasonable priced for the experience. Knowledgeable staff. Took the time to explain the different butterflies and cacoons"
"Nice place to cool off and relax with lots of beautiful butterflies to observe. Trying to get the land on you is a challenge."
"Nothing special if you have seen other butterfly conservatories or even better see butterflies in Nature!"
"Was really well maintained and visually pleasing. Kids loved it. Price not too crazy and they do offer military discounts. Definitely a must do especially if you have kids."
"I have been to many butterfly houses and I have to say I enjoyed this one the most. There are also birds and turtles in this exhibit. Huge variety of butterflies and a gorgeous, well-kept environment. The people are super nice and very helpful and knowledgeable."
"Beautiful butterflies and flamingos were a bonus. I bit expensive, but willing to pay if that is what keeps the conservatory doing what they do."
"Walked into the conservatory and we were amazed at the beauty all around us!!! I think kids would get a kick out of it too..."
"Absolutely brilliant place, from the moment you walk in you are dive bombed (in the nicest way) by beautiful blue butterflies. It's only small but the variety of butterflies is amazing and the birds fascinating especially Scarlett and Rhett the two noisy flamingos!"
"This is an amazing place. It is clear that a lot of thought, love and care went into creating and maintaining this sanctuary. The other variety of birds and turtles were a nice surprise."

"I really enjoyed the butterfly conservatory. My husband, whom I usually have to drag into something like this, actually really enjoyed it!! And he kept talking about it on our drive home. When I first walked into the conservatory, I was really amazed on how many different species there were, and how many butterflies were around us. The plants were... More"
"We truly enjoyed the butterfly house. We thought it sounded like a weird thing to do in Key West but because we saw the high ranking on trip advisor we decided to give it s try. We were very happy we did. I think anyone would enjoy this unusual exhibit."
"Go in and enjoy these tiny, short lived but beautiful creations of mother nature. You'll get to see different species and learn about them."
"The driver for the City View Trolley gave us coupons for a discount. This shares a stop with the Southern Most Point. A nice stop over while between trolleys."
"We enjoyed a visit to this lovely indoor butterfly garden/nature conservatory. We were able to observe Scarlett and Rhet (resident flamingos) perform their mating dance, which was fascinating. Children and adults alike will be delighted by the profusion of beautifully colored butterflies that surround and enchant visitors to this small, but worthwhile site in Key West."
"We (my 18 month old, husband, mother-in-law, and myself) took an afternoon to go to the Butterfly and Nature Conservatory while staying in Ft Myers Beach for the week. We also ate lunch at the Cafe and were pleasantly surprised by both. At lunch, my mother in law and I split a simple and tasty pizza, while my husband had... More"
"The butterfly observatory was very interesting. The butterfly's fly freely and land on you. There are flamingos walking around. It was interesting."
"A great afternoon of photographing butterflies. There was an excellent variety of butterflies and colors. The flamingos were performing synchronized head bobbing, it was spring after all."
"We have visited multiple butterflies conservatories and have never experienced this many butterflies at one time. So many landed on us during our walk through. Flamingos Scarlett and Rhett were quite entertaining as it was mating season. You are able to stand 3 -4 feet from the two. The gift shop is not to be missed!"
"We've been to the Butterfly Conservatory in Niagara Falls, Canada, and it was fantastic. This is smaller, but every bit as much fun. It was just my wife and me this time and she's a butterfly fanatic. We lingered just inside the front door to see the expressions on the faces of the kids as they entered. That alone was... More"
"Super neat experience; I recommend visiting when in Key West. Only downside: the cost. Very pricey for such a tiny place."
"This was one of the highlights of my tour of Key West. It's kind of a hothouse with butterflies and some tropical birds flying free (and a couple of flamingos, too). It was amazing to have the butterflies zooming all around you. If you enjoy taking photos (see the ones posted here), it offers wonderful opportunities for that - I... More"

"This was one of my favorite things in Key West. There are beautiful butterflies everywhere you look! Flying all around and landing on every surface, including you. Make sure you bring a camera. It is quite hot and humid inside, but if you find the big green air vents placed around, you can get a blast of cool air. You... More"
"Beautiful habitat in a small space that does not disappoint. We will post photos later, but this has to be the number one rated attraction in Key West. Great gift shop too."
"Went with my bf and it felt magical with all of the butterflies. It was quite pricey for a 15 minute stroll but it was a very unique and cool experience. You can get $2 off coupons by stopping at any of the water kiosk just around the corner and it will take it down to $10 pp instead of... More"
"We really enjoyed the walk through observing the butterflies, and birds... also turtles and the flamingoes"

"This was our fourth trip to Key West but only first time at the conservatory. My wife suggested that we visit as it is always a top rated attraction. It did not disappoint. The butterflies and birds were very nice. Though quite busy at mid-day (we expected that from their website) it did not distract. We spent around 1/2 hour... More"
"My wife and I visited the conservatory and had a great time. I took a lot of photos of butterflies, as well as Rhett and Scarlet, the resident flamingos. The staff was friendly and you could easily roam without them disturbing you."
"Such a relaxing atmosphere in a uniquely unexpected setting, this is such an enjoyable reward for walking down Duvall Street away fro the heavily trafficked cruise ship end which is so artificial, this is more than worth the few extra minutes walk."

We really weren't sure what to expect but once we got in there and saw so many beautiful butterflies and some birds as well, it was a great joy. It was nice, pretty, sweet. Butterflies even landed on people at times. One landed... More"
"What a neat place! Go in the morning when the butterflies are more active. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of the most beautiful/colorful butterflies you will ever see.

"Beautiful butterflies and some small and cute birds. Mind your step so that you won't step on those creatures!"

"Wonderful experience seeing the vast array of Butterflies, also loved the shopping experience at the end of the trip. Definitely take your camera to this half day event"
"This is an amazing experience. Looking at the establisment from the street would never make you believe what is inside. As you walk through the double entry (it protects butterflies from getting out), you are in a wonderful world. All around you butterflies are floating and alighting on flowers, bushes, trees and people. There are attendants to answer questions also."
"This was an amazing experience. Walking into a room with hundreds of butterfly's all over was almost surreal. Loved it"
"Magical with lots of beautiful butterflies all around us, and lovely little butterfly take-home clips for the kids to have a memory afterwards."

"This place is so much fun! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was amazed by the amount of butterflies in this place! They are literally everywhere flying all around and some even landing on you as you walk. The two flamingos were also very cool to see, we watched them do their courting dance over and over again....

"We spent a short time in the conservatory, but it was gorgeous, and relaxing. The space is small and does not take long to go through, but linger and watch and relax!"
"My husband and I visited here in March 2016. We visited here based on the reviews on TripAdvisor. I would definitely recommend a visit. The butterflies and the amount of them, the colours etc. are stunning. A previous reviewer is right it is a photographers paradise. You walk into a conservatory where the butterflies are just flying past the tip... More"
"This is a do-not-miss attraction. Deeply moving to see adults moved to wonder by these beautiful butterflies. Once inside, you will want to linger. This was our favorite experience of a lovely week."

There are many butterflies floating around. There are also a few species of birds (quail? flamingo) and some fish and turtles in the pond area. Overall, this... More"
"Great place for all ages, raining or not. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The butterflies fly right on you, warning with children who may be afraid not to swat at them. will visit again."
"It's small but well worth the price of entry. FILLED with lovely floating butterflies, small birds and two very engaging flamingoes! We spent WAY more than the 30 minutes we were told it would take to stroll through and we enjoyed every minute!"
"Worth it if you can take your time and enjoy the total change of pace from Duval St. Really lovely. You will walk out feeling re-charged."
"We got some wonderful pictures of butterflies here. The butterflies were a time and there were many. Even teen son liked it. It is very small and doesn't take much time to get through."
"We saw thousands of beautiful butterflies and several exotic birds. While trying to video and take pics, I had a few differ t butterflies land in my hands. Ended up with a few hitchhiker son me for a good while. I absolutely loved the exhibit. Very affordable too."
"As you step from the information room (do spend a few minutes here to learn about the behaviour and life cycle of the butterflies) you immediately smile at the huge array of colours of the butterflies and birds in the aviary. The big blue morphs are numerous and fly in chains along the paths and in and out the people.... More"
"Absolutely worth it. With so many great things to do in Key West, my husband was a little wary of coming to the the Butterfly House, but it was pure magic. Find some coupons and save a few bucks on adult admission. Great for kids, esp young ones learning about insect life cycles. I could have spent HOURS in the... More"
"Extremely well done a perfect visit. Butterflies everywhere. Even on you if you are lucky. Spent more time than we planned."
"Went with my family. Really enjoyed it. Only takes about 10 mins to go around. They have little birds in there too. My son loved it. Very warm though but to be expected as it's the butterflies habitat. Took lots of photos and they stamped your hand so you could go in as many times as you liked during the... More"

"This place was pretty awesome. From the minute you walk in the conservatory there are beautiful butterflies everywhere. They are flying around right in front of your face. It is a short walk thru the conservatory but you can stay in as long as you want & you can take as many pictures as you want. You can also go... More"
"Take the time to tour the conservatory to enjoy the butterflies, little birds, and pink flamingos. The plants are gorgeous. Listen to the classical music playing in this relaxing environment while the birds and butterflies enjoy the treats out for them. Excellent photo ops!"
"Second visit here, always find it relaxing watching the butterflies float around. They have a lovely selection to watch, just need a bench and if only they could serve a martini ;)"
"This Conservatory is absolutely amazing! The only bad thing is that I wished it was larger!! The amount of butterflies was great. And differnt kinds to flitter by and watch! Even birds were flying around. And a pair of resident flamingos, they were gorgeous to watch and listen to---I had no idea that they made such loud honking noises!! It... More"
"Don't miss this place! I wish I could be buried there! Beautiful, peaceful colorful with a friendly staff!"
"This place is like stepping out of reality. Peaceful, beautiful and just breath taking. Suddenly you feel like a child in your favorite children's story. So worth visiting."
"Unbelievable!! So many species, not just butterflies but birds and turtles. This is a great place to spend 60 or 90 minutes in a beautiful, calm environment. Downtown Key West can get busy at times so the butterfly conservatory is a nice place to retreat to for a break. My daughter loved all the creatures and the colours."
"The Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory is a nice little respite from the rest of Key West. The butterflies were everywhere, lighting on everything. Allowing beautiful photos. The flamingos and other birds were really neat to watch as well. Great gift shop!! Loved this place and will consider returning on future trips to Key West."
"Beautiful experience to see tons of butterflies and birds flying around a large conservatory. Many different species and tons of Blue Morphos - very pretty. The butterflies are so close and there's a lot of photo opportunities. I imagine it could get crowded and not as enjoyable, but there weren't many people here when we came. They also have two...

"You must do tthis while you're in Key West! The conservatory is serene and the butterflies are gorgeous."
"This is a quite good butterfly house. There are lots of butterflies and birds. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you have already been to another. butterfly house this is not a must do unless you really like butterflies."

"Love it but ver small and huge line inside, since it is not much space, cool customer service, always get a coupon online in there website. Buy one get one free."
"We were on a trolley tour that stopped here and we were debating on going. Some local on the street heard us talking about it and raved that it was a must-do. Also, the trolley tour guide had recommended it. We chose to and were not disappointed. The butterflies were beautiful and there were lots of them. Also, everyone that... More"

We walked through a few times to really be able to see all of the butterflies and other wildlife. All the butterflies were beautiful and the music in the background made... More"
"We have been to KW twice now, and have never been to the conservatory. We did peruse the gift shop both times however and were very impressed with the butterfly displays. Worth a trip if you are walking by it."
"This place is amazing. Pricey but most things are in Key West. The kids loved all the butterflies flying around. The staff was very knowledgable about the butterflies and even pointed out several of the rare butterflies. They do have a gifts store, so very hard to walk out of there with not purchasing something. They'd do have a web... More"

"I simply cannot imagine anyone not liking butterflies and this Key West location has some of the most beautiful species from around the workd along with tropical plants, birds, a pair of noisey flamingoes (they were mating) and turtles. It is an ideal setting and the buterflies are almost mesmerizing in there gracefulness, beauty and numbers."
"A beautiful conservatory with an array of wildlife inside! I loved how peaceful the butterflies were and the two flamingoes inside were beautiful! Totally worth stopping by!"
"There are tons of butterflies! And even some birds! There are 2 flamingos kept in a small pen which I thought was a bit cruel. You can't touch the butterflies but if you stand still they will land on you!"

"Very nice facility and definitely cool for nature lovers. 6 yr old was a little freaked out, but everyone else loved it."
"Butterflies flying around a small conservatory. While it was interesting and a good retreat from the rain, it is certainly not the #1 thing to do in Key West."
"I expected the many beautiful moths and butterfly's but was surprised and delighted by all the beautiful birds. Lovely brown & white quail hiding in the foliage at your feet as well as iridescent birds flying overhead. In addition to the butterfly's and moths flying around, and occasionally landing on you, there is a display of chrysalis in various stages... More"

"Wonderfully thought out displays with running water, birds and butterflies; will be enjoyed by adults and children alike; allow at least one hour; convenient to many other sites and provides a wonderful gift shopping experience"
"Really well done. Kids and adults loved it. The numbers of butterflies winging the atrium were amazing and absolutely beautiful. We went very early, only a few minutes after it opened. It was very comfortable, easy to move around. When we came out the queue to enter was down the street. We were in Key West for a week and... More"
"Absolutely loved this. It's not a huge place but they have a lot. So beautiful inside; peaceful, relaxing, and full of nature. It's like a lush mini rainforest inside.

"Worth a visit! Not to be misses if you love beautiful things. The butterflies and the birds are stunning."
"I was a little concerned that it may not be for the ""manly man"". Go. You won't be disappointed, really cool place. More butterflies that one could possible count or even begin to count. Great location at the end of Duval street, let it be the beginning or the end of the ""walk Duval""."
"wonderful place, friendly staff, more butterflies than I think I have ever seen, would love to go again and again and again"
"My family stayed just 2 blocks from the conservatory so we popped in not knowing what to expect. I'm so happy we did! It took my breath away to enter a large solarium filled with butterflies - hundreds of them! Just flying around and landing on colorful plants or stopping to eat some mangoes or bananas. I felt like I... More"
"I have been to several butterfly conservatory but this one is definitely unique! Not only do they have several different kind of butterflies, but also Pink Flamingo and the small non flying birds that ran in between the plants. It was definitely a good way to spend about 30 minutes enjoying the view and learning more about butterflies."
"Our 7 year old thought this place was magical. Blue butterflies (morpho peleides) floated blissfully by, Atlas butterflies waiting for that perfect day (they only get about 4 days in their aviary life), a bunch of little button quail running about, some type of Java finch, and a host of other butterflies from South America and Asia. Throughout the walk,... More"

"We heard about the Butterfly and Nature Conservatory while on the trolley tour of Key West and decided to visit. There were so many butterflies, it was amazing! Hard to take it all in. Everywhere you I looked there was another butterfly or bird. And, all the plants were beautiful."
"Not what I expected. It was serene, beautiful and peaceful. I could have stayed allll day! Plus you can revisit all day on the same day as your paid admission. All I could think of was a spa setting!"

"This place is really lovely. We enjoyed it, but how is it the number one attraction? Did no one else notice the beach? Plan to spend about 45 minutes to an hour. There’s a gift shop in front, an explanation area and then the enclosure with birds as well as butterflies."
"Very pretty. Clean . Found a lot of information on butterflies. Liked the birds. Colors were amazing!"
"With 2 young kids, we have been to a lot of butterfly exhibits. This is as nice as any of them, but it was super crowded on the day we went. I'm not sure there are cruise ship groups through here or what but it was like the traffic coming in on Route 1 into Key West, total standstill. My... More"
"$12 per adult may seem like a lot at first, especially for a 15-30 min experience. But it was really cool, even if you are the son of a science teacher who did the whole chrysalis thing at home.

"This was an awesome tour. Butterfly's everywhere. The pink flamingo's didn't disappoint either. This tour is good for all ages."
"Wow! Very pleasantly surprised. What a beautiful and interesting place...and perfect for the young kids and moms. An up close and real experience with nature...the flamingoes were a great touch. Relax, take your time away from the Key West party crowd. Beautiful oasis."
"The place its nothing but a huge garden full of butterflies. Its very pretty. You are not allowed to touch the butterflies but they often get on you or fly very close to you. I think is a little overprice for what it is. Entrance should be no more than $5. $12 is too much for a small garden."
"Go here just to look around the gift shop, the shop sells mounted butterflies that are exquisite. The conservatory is a $12 dollars enterance fee so we skipped that part. Enjoy the browsing."
"Such a cute little stop while your in key west, for any age. Hundreds of butterflies, cute little birds, flamingos, etc! The employees are super sweet and very friendly. A fun experience while I was in the key"
"We need to kill some time before leaving Key West. My husband was happy taking lost of pictures, mostly of butterflies. I was more interested in the flamingos. This place is very expensive for it's size. Hopefully, the profits go to environmental programs"
"Such beauty. Such serenity. It is one of the most amazing places to step out of the hustle and bustle of Duval - into the tranquility of the Conservatory. We all just loved it ! Will go back."
"This place gives a special twist to Key West. If you enjoy nature and want to see a great conservatory effort this place allows you to see butterflies emerging from the Pupa, shares information that you can return with to your own garden, and has many photo opportunities. The flamingos you see along the way are a special treat."
"Amazing conservatory full of gorgeous butterflies, birds, and turtles. We spent hours observing and taking pictures here. The staff was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. We absolutely LIVED our visit!!"

"Calm music, water features, small song birds and beautiful butterflies. I could take or leave the flamingos, especially during mating season."
"Who knew that a conservatory full of butterflies could be so fun...but it was! Actually it was magical. Really worth a visit for both adults and children."
"Tons of amazing butterflies. Some beautiful birds, and even 2 flamingos. Relaxing.. There was some sitting to relax & observe, wish there was more. The store was exceptional. Look for $2 off admission price coupons."
"It was pretty. But 12 a person. Back home we have a butterfly house that's half that price and just as nice. But it was pretty. And the gift shop had some beautiful art. But if I was looking to do just one or two things go see the Hemingway house or the little white house."
"We weren't sure what to expect but wanted to try it out since it was so highly rated on Trip Advisor. It was pretty cool! It's not that big so it doesn't take long to walk through, but the butterflies were so beautiful! The staff was very friendly and informative, every time they passed they would share a fun fact....

"We went to this remarkable place on our last full day in Key West. I loved the amount of different kinds of butterflies and beautiful selection of birds.

Best to go in the morning and if you want butterflies to land on you I suggest wearing something yellow."
"The butterflies are beautiful, as are the plants & flowers. However, it was very crowded and we had to shuffle along a path. I was shocked when we arrived back at the gift shop in a short amount of time. The butterfly area is not large and I was expecting nature exhibits beyond the butterfly section."
"An oasis of peace,beauty and serenity amid the crowds in Key West.This was my favorite attraction on the island."
"They will sell you ticket at 4:20 then tell you its only good until 4:30 pm. Not right. As a former Ad Exec, there is an FTC issue here--advertise that you are open until 5:30 pm. Then sell ticket at 4:20 pm. Tell patron its only good for 10 more minutes??? So, you lost my business today. Otherwise, I have... More"
"Much better than one we visited in Branson, MO years ago. Staff was very friendly, and the flamingos were an added attraction."
"This little gem was a great surprise. We were told to go in the morning when butterflies are most active. Could hardly believe our eyes. There are sooo many gorgeous butterflies and birds from all over the world - all dancing and singing for your enjoyment."
"They had some problems with the power so we had to wait in line for ages. When we got in the experience was over in 5 min so it's seemed bit wasted to queue up that long and it was also bit pricey considering how small it was. But it was nice place."
"I was told when I go to Key West I had to check this place out and it was worth it. Good for all age groups and not too expensive, good pricing."
"It's beautiful. Simple as that! There are several different species, but you must look everywhere. At first it really seems like it's all the giant blue butterflies, but there are many many others. It's a bit hot and humid, but that's what the butterflies like. Many different butterfly plants, and several birds too. A good place for everyone of all... More"
"As good as advertised; amazing butterfly assortment. The birds and turtles were a surprise. Butterfly nursery was a good way to exceed expectations -- large variety breaking out of cocoons in front of our eyes. Too cool. A little surprise how much my teen enjoyed it."
"An awesome experience and value. Lovely and tranquil. More butterflies than you can imagine. Every size and shape. One landed on the girl friend who wore a bright yellow top. Loved it !"
"We enjoyed our walkthrough during our Key West trip. In addition to a multitude of varieties of butterflies they also had a variety of birds. Kids would especially enjoy this but fun for us grown ups too."
"My wife and I stopped in to see the butterfly theme store and then found out about the section with all the live butterflies flying around along with some beautiful birds. We stayed in there for a long time taking tons of pictures. This is a must do when in Key West and something people of all ages can enjoy."
"The best of key west. Just beautiful and very informative. Excellent friendly knowledgable staff. Very highly recommended. Aaa"
"We walked approx. 20 minutes from the cruise port to get to the Key West Butterfly and took a taxi back (10$). Our 7 y.o. daughter enjoyed the butterflies. Very crowded, it takes no more than 15 minutes to go around. We went around twice. OK for kids, not sure if I would go alone."
"It was a nice visit. The most interesting part of the visit was the pair of flamingos - beautiful and very vocal. Good gift shop as well."
"The gift shop is amazing!! We went there twice...each time spending 1-2 hours. So detailed and fun. Delightful and helpful staff. My family toured the butterfly display and thoroughly enjoyed it!! With flamingo's ""talking"" during their mating season. Way more than just butterflies! A must see...if ""only"" the gift shop!!"
"Enter a world of science and fantasy filled with birds, butterflies and flamingos. It is humid like a tropical rain forrest with a butterfly hatchery and wonderful gift shop."
"Very educational, but the best part was simply being surrounded by so many butterflies! Very good for all ages."
"My husband and I went here after reading the reviews. It's actually a very small conservatory. The day we went it was very crowded which made it difficult to move along the sidewalk. The butterflies were beautiful and so were the small birds and quail which were also inside. I got some amazing pictures as the butterflies will often land... More"
"You cant miss this place! You shouldn't. Such a small place with beautiful garden and butterflies flying everywhere, makes you feel in paradise!"
"Been to other such places; this one is top notch. Very crowded tho better to go early. Good education and fun to experience. Enjoyed the exotic birds as well."
"My husband and I had the pleasure of spending a few hours in this truly amazing place. We visited Key West at the heart of Spring Break and we're looking for some quiet and peace. We lucked into this almost etherial place full of colorful d light file butterflies and birds. We planned to stay an hour and stay d... More"
"I wasn't keen on visiting but am glad I did. I had no idea what agile fliers butterflies are. Great music, Bonnie and Clyde the Cranes, and hundreds of butterflies. Amazing"
"We didn't think the teen daughters would enjoy as much as they did! Look for coupons in fliers, usually $2 off. Butterfly area was teaming with different butterfly's and some interesting birds, including two flamingos. Winding path through small area took about 20 minutes, with butterflies landing everywhere. Two places to sit. Gift shop had some cute items related to... More"
"Loved it. This was a great way to get out of the sun and see some beautiful butterflies. The flamingos and birds were an added bonus! Gift shop was top notch."
"Very pretty! A butterfly even landed on me! Very fun, but not exactly the best place in Key West. But still, a must see!"
"I visited on a family cruise. The 20s and 30 year olds made a beeline for Duval Street. Auntie and Grandpa headed out for water sports and Grandma got to take an 18 month old to the Butterfly conservancy. It was a great choice although the little one was more interested in the creek that ran through it than in... More"
"This attraction is always great. Stop and read the informative slides in the entrance and the enter the charming area of the butterflies. Great gift shop as well."
"We loved our visit to the butterfly conservatory! It's hot and humid, but worth the frizzy hair :) Such a peaceful place and beautiful environment. We could have stayed for hours! A must-see in Key West!"
"I'm not a big fan of taking trips to places with a high volume of kids, but this excursion was still fun. Lots and lots of butterflies, as well as the opportunity to see plenty of birds (including tiny button quail) and flamingos in an indoor setting. I would recommend wearing a short-sleeved shirt/tank top and shorts, as the temperature... More"
"The place is actually much smaller than anticipated. They had a lot of the same blue colorful butterflies. Not too many different variety as expected but more than enough to enjoy. The back of the building want a small screened in viewing area with a lush garden with a small winding path through it. It gets a little crowded and... More"
"We visited here a number of years ago but decided to go again since the couple we were traveling with had not. It was pretty crowded the day we went in but there's enough space in the exhibit area, butterfly habitat, and the gift shop for many. The exhibit at the beginning is very informative and discusses the life cycle... More"
"This place is so interesting. We truly enjoyed all of the information and seeing so many interesting butterflys. But the flamingos were a real treat! Great for all ages"
"To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed by this place. It is ranked as the number one attraction in Key West so I guess I expected more. it's quite small and limited in the number of butterflies compared to others I've been in."
"Enjoyable and educational experience seeing wonderful butterflies in natural habitat up close and personal"
"Great conservatory full of plants, butterflies, birds and flamingos. No parking, and watch your children, they really try to protect the butterflies from curious children that want to chase and touch. But they are good and try,to,make it a teaching experience. Get a trolley map, it has a $2 per person discount admission off full price admission. Listen to their... More"
"Wonderful, peaceful setting with a variety of wildlife. Love the addition of the flamingos. Note there are also a variety of birds in the conservancy that are very photogenic. Always coupons available for discount admission."
"Exotic tropical plants, brightly plumed birds, and over 1000 free flying butterflies/moths with amazing colors and patterns surround you as you walk though the Butterfly Conservatory in Key West. A unique experience and unexpected find. Go--you'll enjoy it!"
"A nice stop near the southernmost point. There are lots of butterflies flying everywhere. There are also nice birds. À bit expensive for the short visit, but the ticket is good all day."
"We loved this magical experience!! Amazing variety of birds and butterflies in a beautiful setting! I actually went twice...once with a friend & then again with Hubby"
"Of all the things we did during our week long stay on Key West, this was by far the most incredible. I truly never expected this to be so fabulous. As we stepped into the butterfly area, you couldn't help but smile - and giggle with happiness! Colorful butterflies gliding all around; flamingoes in the midst of a mating display;... More"
"Either for a half hour to get out of the heat or for a few hours to enjoy the sights, the conservatory offers up a worthwhile attraction. Parking is available around back and it is free. Wife and I had a great time. Worth the price of admission."
"We had read great things about this Conservatory during last year's trip to Key West but never got around to visiting. This year we decided to move it up the list, and visited on a Friday afternoon. Our visit was well worth the price of admission (+/- $9 per person for seniors). Prior to entering the actually conservatory, you can... More"
"This was a wonderfully nice surprise. The butterflies, birds, plants and sounds were all beautiful, relaxing and interesting. We lucked out and were able to watch a butterfly hatch. The staff was great about answering any questions that people had and it was very evident that they truly enjoy their job and craft. We liked it so much that we... More"
"Very enjoyable. The butterflies are everywhere, some flow you around and land on you. The birds keep the action going, also."
"My wife talked me into going to the Butterfly Conservatory. Glad she did. It was very interesting and nice to watch all the different butterflies that surrounded you. Nice gift shop too."
"My wife and I enjoyed visiting this Conservatory on an unusually cool day in the Keys - the 80 degree temperatures felt great! Very interesting learning more about butterflies and then seeing so many up close - in many cases - landing on us! Gift shop had many nice things, but was much too small for all that was on... More"
"We have visited other butterfly conservatories and thought this was a very nice one ( as are the ones in Chattanooga TN and at Fairchild Gardens in Miami). Nice selection of butterflies, wonderful plantings, interesting birds-- we even went back at 3:00 in the afternoon to watch the bird feelings! There is a good film to watch, plenty of places... More"
"This was well worth a visit. If you are traveling with kids, this is a must see in Key West. Very magical"
"Great butterfly museum. It's wonderful to stroll amid the numerous butterflies, birds, and other animals (did see one turtle). A good variety of butterflies and lots of them!"
"Upon entering you are met with peaceful 'spa' music. Rhett and Scarlett are 2 beautiful flamingos that ""talked"" the entire time we were there. Beautiful koi, big turtles, orchids and flowers everywhere. Paths and bridges and you sometimes must wait for tiny little Japanese grouse families to cross in front of you so watch where you step! Colorful birds. Just... More"
"We LOVED the butterfly conservancy - we parked near them by coincidence and took advantage of the free re-entry to enjoy the butterflies before we left that day. The birds are interesting too- especially the flamingo pair and the tiny quail. Take time to watch for adult butterflies emerging from their chrysalis in the window at the end of the... More"
"First, it was very interesting and a fun place. Very reasonable pricing and great gift shop. Only wish it was larger and more species."
"We had an excellent time with all the butterflies and of course the very noisy Rhett and Scarlett (flamingoes). There were so many morpha's. More than I saw in Costa Rica. I'd recommend to any butterfly lover."
"As you enter the Conservatory, there is a feeling that every moment will be filled with the element of surprise. The flora combined with all the creatures that exist in this ""Eden"" is truly a slice of Paradise. Anyone visiting Key West needs to take a tour of this magical 'gem'!"
"Each year we go KW and each year we go to this wonderful conservatory for birds and butterfly's. GO & Enjoy this delightful facility --- the beauty and color and sounds are GREAT"
"Was totally amazed at the number of butterflies! Well worth the trip ! Loved the flamingos too ! Rhett and Scarlet .. Rhett was very vocal hope he's successful in getting Scarlet ""in the mood """
"Just a beautiful little place with all types of butterflies. They are beautiful, just so colorful and there are so many !! It was fun and quick and easy to get through."
"Lovely little garden area.butterflies galore! Make sure you don't pick up any hitchhikers when you leave. 2 lovely flamingos and a lot of other birds roaming around. I wish I had a huge greenhouse like that at my house."
"We really did not have high expectations so we were really impressed. The butterflies were beautiful and plentiful. The flamingos were really cool as were the other birds. It did not take long to see the attraction but you could stay as long as you wanted and could also come back in later in the day for no additional fee.... More"
"Went by myself to this little gem. Walked slowly through the path and took tons of pics. I bought a few items in the gift store but with I had brought cash as there is some amazing artisan work there."
"The butterflies are so beautiful! They offer discounts for military and locals. Stop by the gift shop, you'll want to buy some great art work to mark the occasion."
"The butterflies were beautiful! Before entering there is a very interesting video; educational & amazing💕 This is a must see! Their gift shop is fantastic!"
"I always stop by the butterfly center for a quick, but quiet walk through their butterfly filled exhibit. It lowers my blood pressure a few points every time. It can get busy so I recommend being their when they first open. Also allow more than one day to try going in case there are tour groups. They stamp your hand... More"
"The butterfly conservatory is a wonderful place to visit. There are so many beautiful butterflies to see in addition to birds & plants. Watch out for the occasional bird walking across the path at your feet or the butterflies that accidently fly into you. If they land on you, get a good picture. Don't worry - they don't bite! If... More"
"A busy little place but our 3 young kids (and us) loved it! You walk through a climate/moisture controlled greenhouse filled with thousands of butterflies, tropical plants, birds (two flamingos), stream/turtles. It was a ""magical"" place to spend an hour in. You can re-enter as many times as you want all day, so you can get your moneys worth! Just... More"
"The moment you step in large beautiful butterflies are everywhere. As an added treat there are also pink flamingoes, really nice birds and turtles. Definitely a must do, we really enjoyed it"
"Not only did you see hundreds of exotic butterflies but one is instructed in a great explanation of the life cycle and diversity of butterflies. We planted a butterfly garden bec of this experience."
"Nice conservatory. Overpriced for the size. Try to get a discount coupon. Limited butterfly varieties. Birds were beautiful. Flamingos were very engaging. Small but peaceful and serene."
"Great venue. A world away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street. Beautiful plantings and fauna. Endless supply of butterflies of all varieties. Two wonderful flamingos. Very friendly and love to pose with visitors. A group of pre-schoolers were there and you could see the joy on their faces. It made the visit all the more special. Lovely gift... More"
"Every time I go to Key West, I visit the Butterfly Conservatory. I could spend hours there, but tend to limit myself to one to two hours. You first enter a room that has information on butterflies - lots to learn! Inside the main conservatory, there is a wide variety of butterflies and moths, small Guinea fowl, flamingos, fish, and... More"
"Opportunity to see hundreds of butterflies in a natural environment, flamingoes and small birds too. Peaceful moment against the backdrop of Key West."
"This is probably the best butterfly collection I have ever seen! The number of butterflies on exhibits must number near 70-80 species (probably around 10,000 butterflies). They also feature baby quail, various birds (finches), turtles, and two pink flamingos (Scarlett & Rhett;Rhett is a laugh a minute, with all his preening). The gift shop is a marvelous collections of butterfly... More"
"Well worth the money to see tropical birds and butterflies. They have the only flamingos we saw on the trip. They were very talkative. I had a hitchhiker butterfly but he moved on before we left. There are lots of coupons around. Make sure you get one two save $2 off each admission."
"I would suggest making this a stop on my tour of Key West if you haven't experienced free flying butterflies and birds elsewhere. The flora and fauna is beautiful too. Staff was very friendly and would be glad to answer any questions you have. The gift shop is just about as big as the conservatory and, of course you have... More"
"We spent far more time here than we anticipated the almost hypnotic music and the beauty of the Butterfly's is something not to be missed a welcome break in this party town."
"We saved this visit for the real day of our vacarion, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, I went through twice because there was so much to see. The down side of going in on a rainy day was that it was so crowded. I would liked to have gone when it was quiet so should have had my first... More"
"Went to the Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory - it was a beautiful sunny morning and the butterflies were magnificent. So many colors and hues. Enjoyed the pink flamingos too - it is the beginning of mating season and they were calling to each other. I would definitely spend more time there if we were alone, but our friends... More"
"Small place… with a lot of love and care put into it… Quite expensive though… Very nice for children"
"This was the best $20 bucks we spent in Key West. This is a fantastic experience, equally appealing for individuals of every age. The conservatory is a fabulous environment, full of birds, butterflies, and flowering plants. Getting up close and personal with the butterflies and flamingoes was a great experience. I took 60 great photos in about a half hour.... More"
"This was an OK tour in Key West. The butterflies and pink flamingos are beautiful. The conservatory itself to me was small. Of course, they have to keep the climate in a certain way for the benefit of their tenants (butterflies). It can be uncomfortable for the visitors (people). It was very warm & humid. The girls went on the... More"
"What a great place for families! The kids get a butterfly identification sheet and loved seeing the multitude of butterflies and birds around! A truly beautiful place with lots to see."
"Touring the Butterfly Conservatory was peaceful, beautiful and relaxing way to spend an hour or two. Excellent place, well organized, knowledgeable volunteers."
"We did not do the tour, but their gift shop is amazing. You can buy butterflies that are secured in these plexi glass boxes for decoration and they are reasonably priced and beautiful. very unique gifts and they package them in bubble wrap for your travels. They also have a smaller gift shop near Mallory Square."
"It's a small place with a lot of beautiful birds and butterflies. You can go through at a leisurely pace. Of course pictures are allowed. I really enjoyed it"
"This conservatory is small but packed with butterflies and birds. It is beautiful and well-run, and there is an informational video to watch before entering the actually conservatory. It's $12/person, so a bit pricey for a quick stop, but it's well worth visiting if you consider the cost of entry as a donation to preserve this opportunity to visit these... More"
"Loved this experience, definitely do not pass this up! A wonderful experience for young and old! Butterfly's are everywhere along with flamingos and tiny colorful birds."
"A peaceful way to spend a few hours in Key West. The store has a beautiful selection of butterfly art and a variety of other items. Bring your camera."
"Six of us visited the center and enjoyed every minute of the experience. You start with an excellent video and introduction - take time to view the video, the narrative and the photography are excellent. The butterfly conservatory is wonderful with many butterflies and birds in a natural environment, along with a side hatching room where you can see butterflies... More"
"We visit the Key West Butterfly conservatory at least once, and usually twice, when we vacation in Key West (even for a week) - its that magical a place. Guaranteed stress reduction, too....

"Many different kinds of butterflies. Also birds, flamingos, turtles, and fish. Can go through at your own pace. We were never rushed or hurried through. Gifts reasonably priced souvenir shop ."
"Pretty cool place. Don't know how it's the number one attraction in all of Key West, but the butterfly enclosure is worth a stop."
"Before going I had heard that we would be swarmed with butterflies -- that did not happen. The gift shop is much more colorful than the actual butterfly area. What I enjoyed most was the 15 minute video before going into see the butterflies - very informative about the life of a butterfly. It only takes a few minutes to... More"
"Just spectacular! Great thing to do in any kind of weather...for kids of all ages! Have camera -- so many beautiful shots all the way through."
"I visited during the Flamingos mating season so they were very active with the spreading of the wings and the noise to get attention. It was quite the show! The butterflies and bird variety was incredible. At the end of the conservatory there is a window were you can watch the cocoons hatch into butterflies. Really nice. I was able... More"
"This is exactly what you expect from a butterfly conservatory. Lots of butterfly'ss.... If you're like me and a butterfly is a butterfly, then this conservatory is like every other butterfly conservatory. If you're like my wife and love butterfly's and nature, you'll love this place. Worth a stop!"
"This was our first time to do a Butterfly Conservatory visit. As well as all the beautiful butterflies, the plants, flowers, and birds were equally amazing. The staff were very friendly and were well prepared to answer all of our questions. We highly recommend this to all nature lovers."
"Key West is not very family friendly, but this place is and the Butterfly museum is very neat and interesting. Definitely not the bar scene, which is nice."
"This is a well-maintained and quiet spot to see plants and birds in a setting away from the crowds. Great for families and others who would like a walk through nature that is not strenuous nor long! Beautiful!"
"Such an interesting place to visit. They have a lot of Natures Jewels packed in a relatively small garden. But I could spend hours there? Love it."
"I couldn't take enough pictures of all the beautiful butterflies,plants & flowers. It was so neat having them land on you weather it be your head, arm, or shoulder."

"I read all the reviews on what to do in Key West...this was number one and now I know why. It's easy to get to by bike or walking if you're staying in old town. Went on a Saturday, thought it would be really crowded but was pleasantly surprised. When you walk through the doors for the first time it... More"
"This was a fun stop in Key West. Very crowded, but the flow was good. The gift shop was a bit overwhelming: packed with merchandise and people."

"Who doesn't smile when surrounded by beautiful, delicate, floating butterflies everywhere! This is a totally wonderful experience. It can be a bit hot and humid because that's what the little floating creatures need. If you can get past that, you will have a great time seeing such beautiful butterflies. The shop is also nice for purchasing gifts and prezzies! You... More"
"Loved the Butterfly Conservatory. The gorgeous butterflies, birds, plants,flamingoes, and soft music make it a beautiful oasis right off of Duval Street. My only issue would be it should be a bit larger. Maybe a place to sit and read a book? Narrow path winds around solarium and before you know it, it's over. There is no time limit so... More"
"My 12 year old daughter could have spent the entire day here. The animals and scenery were beautiful. The price was good for the amount of enjoyment. Lots of wonderful photo opportunities and a chance to relax and take a break. The gift shop was also very charming with lots of reasonably priced treasures."
"We didn't pay to go into the conservatory. The butterfly gallery attached to the gift shop was gorgeous. There is a huge variety of beautiful butterfly displays. Even the bug displays were beautiful."
"We loved walking through the butterflies. There were so many of so many colors. There were also little birds flitting here and there. In the middle, were some noisy flamingos who gave a little performance. Very nice place."
"This place is like a little peace of heaven. The place it small, but so beautiful it's worth visiting."
"Few things transport you to an enchanted and magical place. The Conservatory is one. They do a great job of explaining the life of butterflies. But nothing prepares you for stepping into the space with the hundreds of butterflies & dozens of exotic birds. Having a butterfly gently land on your shoulder is a rare experience. It really is a...

"We visited in the morning when butterflies were at their best. Went back at 5 PM to enjoy the birds."

"I love the magical feeling of the butterfly conservatory! Well maintained and freindly staff, I had a wonderful visit!"

"If you are in Key West, this is a must see! I've never seen so many beautiful butterflies in one place."
"While cruising around Key West, we found this unassuming storefront to a huge 'mansion-esque' building, beckoning us to see & learn a little about Butterflies. Why not?, we thought. Upon entering it was immediately obvious that this was no small scaled Conservancy - it was spacious! The incredible variety of butterflies flitting while stopping briefly to feed on fruits, little... More"

The place is small but it is an enchanted enclosure that brings you to a magic place with beautiful butterflies flying all around you, pink flamingoes, little birds... More"
"Essentially this Conservatory is a great big room full of butterflies, a few birds and a couple of flamingos. If that sounds boring to you, you probably won't enjoy it. But if that sounds amazing to you, you probably will enjoy spending a peaceful 30 minutes or so away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street experiencing the peace... More"
"Unlike many ""tourist"" venues in Key West, this one is fun and interesting, and at least for me, well worth the price of admission. LOTS of butterflies, birds, turtles and a great many color photo ops. Be warned that humidity is high and the place is warm, so dress accordingly. If your cameras / lenses / film (if you shoot...

"This is a good butterfly museum. It is worth spending one to two hours during your Key West stay. Sit and watch the butterflies and birds."
"I would recommend this to anyone who is not freaked out by butterflies! I discovered my daughter is.

"The Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory is a small tropical greenhouse on the south end of Duval Street.

"We heard about this place from family members and we are very happy we went! The butterflies and flamingoes are awesome! The inside of the building is larger than it looks with a winding path through the garden and a small pool/stream.

The overall setting...the music, occasional bird and turtle, the profusion of plants and of course the large number of butterflies and make for a really relaxing experience."
"I visited the conservatory and while the Blue Butterfly's were very nice and the sounds and smell of the space was also, it was quite small and not a ton of variety in species.

"The number and beauty of the butterflies in this lovely oasis exceeded my expectations. The plants, flamingos and little quail added to the experience. I could have spent a morning or afternoon just sitting, enjoying this place. On the downside, it was crowded when my friends and I visited on a Thursday in early afternoon."
"Because the conservatory is small, you really feel the press of people. There are some really nice butterflies. The explanatory videos and displays before you enter the conservatory are good. If you see a big tour bus parked outside of the building, go do something else and return another time."

"This tourist attraction near the Sourthernmost Point is a good place to bring younger visitors in a city much better known for adult activities. Butterflies are everywhere inside the glassed in greenhouse, to the point you're advised to look in a mirror at the exit to ensure you're not taking any outside with you as uninvited riders."

"This place is amazing. You are transformed into a butterfly Wonderland. I have never been to a place with such a variety of butterflies which magically make you feel like you're in another world. Great for kids of all ages"
"Wow. Butterflies everywhere! A lot more than I expected or have seen elsewhere. Plus, flamingos, finches, tiny quails and a turtle. I never expected to be 18 inches from and looking eye to eye with a flamingo! This is NOT a tourist trap! It is a great place to take the kids, or to visit on a rainy day, or... More"
"If you love being surrounded by butterflies and want to support nature conservancy, this place is worth the price of entry. I do, so it was. It's about the experience. Go early, get your hand stamped for all-day re-admission, and return later to observe b'fly (and bird!) behavior in the afternoon."
"We loved this place! Extremely relaxing and Zen-like. This is a great place to get away from the noise, commotion of Duval Street and unwind."
"We visited the Butterfly and Nature Conservatory on a rainy day and, though we didn't spend a long time there, it was good. We have been to other butterfly exhibits that were as good, but did enjoy the fact that there were flamingos, other birds and fish in the exhibit as well as butterflies. They have an excellent gift shop,... More"
"Visited this afternoon. We really enjoyed ourselves. The locals all asked if we saw their flamingos. It is right around the corner from the southern most point in the US."
"We have been to a number of butterfly conservatories/farms, but this one is by far the best we have visited. Highly recommend."
"This a place not to miss on your trip down to Key West. I felt as if I was in another world. It is magical walking among the butterflies!"
"We loved the butterflies, birds and turtles, and the plants. I would recommend a visit, and you get a free butterfly and entry all day once you have paid once."
"This is one of the top attractions in Key West, and one we have been to many times. From the minute you walk through the entrance doors of the giant glass domed aviary, you are surrounded by thousands of exotic butterflies! Add this to the tropical birds flying overhead, the 2 resident flamingos, the little grouses (small, plump ground birds),... More"

"Best butterfly conservatory that I have been to. Simply beautiful, but it can get crowded quickly. Go at the end of the day if possible (around 4)"
"This attraction is just a 'run of the mill' butterfly house. You can see the same in many other U.S. and Canada locations."
"We had a fantastic experience visiting with our 2 year old who just loved the very sight of the butterflies. Children just love it. Loved the colors, the setting and the fact that it is on Duval street itself. A good tip would be to wear something light because it gets pretty warm and humid in there. Entrance tickets are...

"Great place to view butterflies, birds, and tropical plants in a pretty natural setting. We'll worth the price of admission."
"Very informative. Beautiful exhibit. I liked that the preserved butterflies were species that lived out their full life."
"OK, I stole the title from my wife's description of the visit. She became a 10 year old girl once she walked through the double doors into the exhibit. Butterflies flew around us the entire time we were inside. Even better, they would land on you as one did on her. Besides the butterflies, there are ground birds, parrots and... More"
"This was opposite our accommodation and a lovely surprise. The butterflies are so pretty and they have 2 flamingoes Rhett & Scarlett. The gift shop is jam packed with every butterfly memento you could imagine."
"Overall, nothing crazy here. Yes, beautiful butterflies, but I'm not quite sure why this is the number one attraction. Much more to see and do in Key West that was much more entertaining to me."
"Thanks again to Vacation Key West for setting us up with tickets to this very special experience. It's a not a big place but it feels like walking into a completely different world from the busy and crowded Duval street. The butterflies are spectacular, but so are the little birds and the flamingos. The tropical setting is amazing. Definitely worth... More"
"We visited here based on a friend's recommendation. We were glad to have stopped. While not as big as the one in Niagara Falls, it was still a very pleasant visit. In addition to lots of butterflies flying about, there were also several species of birds throughout including two very visible flamingos. I would definitely recommend this to singles, couples...

You can see how butterflies are evolved from caterpillars. I highly recommend to people of all ages."
"Loved this place highly recommend a visit. They are so beautiful and it is so peaceful. The flamingoes were a bonus. You can watch butterfly's hatching awesome. Take a video they move too fast for still shots."

"This is a nice relaxing break from the usual tourist places. Meditative environment with birds, flamingos, butterflies, and flowers surrounding you."
"We arrived at Key West the afternoon before and thought we'd squeeze in a butterfly visit, but it was really crowded. One of the staffers there shared that the butterflies are more active in the morning. So we held off and are glad we did. They opened at 9 and we got there right when they opened. We had the...

"I had a great time taking photos (once my lens acclimated to the humidity). It's small but there is so much to look at. I would definitely go again."
"We went there to see the butterflys. We have been to other butterfy museums and this one was top notched. So many butterflys flying around the museum. I would love to return again."
"The conservatory was recommended so we visited. It was beautiful: the butterflies, birds, plants and fish. However, we were in and out in a matter of minutes. The gift shop was bigger than the conservatory! Do it to say you did it, but it's a little pricey for the time it took."
"Smiles on all the faces and beautiful butterflies, birds, and flamingos! You are able to leave and return at any time throughout the day. Just show your stamp!"
"We went through twice it was so cool. When you first enter, it is almost a little overwhelming there are so many butterflies! It was so beautiful I teared up! The second trip through the butterflies started landing on me! It was a unique and really wonderful experience overall!"
"My wife dragged me to this and was I surprised. It was a very enjoyable experience and far more fun than I expected. Surrounded by thousands of beautiful butterflies it was amazing. I had a floral print shirt which really attracted them. I had several on me at all times. Don't overlook this attraction while on the island. Certainly worth... More"
"I knew my wife would love it and she did. I was pleasantly surprised how much I too enjoyed it. Very cool place, very clean and evident how much ownership cares. Reasonable cost and a good break from Duval."
"Breathakingly beautiful varieties butterflies and birds. A real tropical paradise in the middle of town. Of course it's crowded and you have to work to avoid bumping into people, but you can stay as long as you like. Adults and kids were loving it, teenagers looked mostly bored. Everyone ignores the instruction to not take pictures. One thing though: it... More"
"First off, note that there are more than just butterflies. The conservatory host birds, turtles, and a couple of flamingos. The butterflies tend to steal the show, but the other wildlife is impressive too. I'd set aside at least a half hour to wander around and take pictures. Bring a lens good for close up photography if you have it,... More"
"Wonderful conservatory with introductory room giving information on butterflies in general. We then proceeded through double doors to enter the main room. Here were literally thousands of bright colourful butterflies of all sizes and shapes. The good sized room had abundant jungle type plants and a lovely stone walkway through the exhibit. The room was quite warm and humid, but... More"
"No one rushing you through, in fact you can come back anytime during the same day to revisit. Plenty of places to sit and relax and watch the beautiful butterflies , birds and fish. Awesome gift shop! Definitely will go back, never gets old going here!"
"This place was a hit for all of our group of 6, including our two grandkids who made ""best friends"" with the beautiful flamingos. I've never seen flamingos so close up. A well designed, memorable exhibit, chock full of butterflies, birds, even a turtle or two. We've been to several butterfly gardens, including the one at the Smithsonian and this... More"
"Such a great small and well kept place. Here you can find lots of varieties of butterflies and some birds too. Don't forget to take your camera coz you will have plenty of beautiful butterfly pictures taken here. Even though the place was small, they have a good number and variety of butterflies. We were able to get $2.00 off... More"
"Seemed like it might be hokey BUT IT WAS AMAZING! Beautiful birds, butterflies all around, flamingoes, and tropical flowers. Photographers delight, everyone was having a good time."
"Really. They have done an amazing job curating an array of God's finest delicate creations. The colors, the species, the plants, the birds - it is in beautiful harmony. The garden staff was knowledgeable and helpful - wanting to share with us about the flowers, and the birds as well. The gift shop & gallery employees were just as delightful... More"
"This place is great. The butterflys are beautiful and well presented. Not a large place but worth an hour of your time"
"This place was unexpected on Duval Street. There were butterflies from all over the world. The staff was very informative and the environment, including the Pelicans and many other birds, made for a wonderful visit. A photo hint would be to take a video of a butterfly in slow motion, then get a screen shot for a great picture."
"It lovely to see all the butterflies up close and them flying around. There are also small birds plus two flamingos. This is worth a visit."
"Although small, a lot has been packed into this attraction. A good selection of beautiful coloured butterflies and an added attraction of mainly little birds"
